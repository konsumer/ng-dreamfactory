# ng-dreamfactory

In the the `todoangular` demo I downloaded from DreamFactory, I noticed that it wasn't actually using Angular, so I made this. The DreamFactory service is reusable, and pretty easy to work with. I also show off Angular's awesome binding with disabled buttons & hidden things when they do not apply.

You can see it in action, [here](http://konsumer.github.io/ng-dreamfactory/)

I think this could be greatly improved if things were moved to `$http`, and the shred/swagger stuff was not used.

## Usage

Go edit lib/demo.js, change `dsp_url` & `app_name`.
